# Description and Purpose
> This API allows users to search for nutrition and diet data for generic foods,packed foods and restaurant dishes. This API has a Natural 
> Language Processing (NLP) feature which extracts food entities from unstructured text within search queries.
## IDEA: Food and Nutrition
> As a developed country,Singapore has many available food resources. There is a wide variety of foods for people to choose. But little do they
> know what those foods a made up of(i.e Nutrients and dietary.) 
> Hence,this website can allow users to search for food ingredients and see nutritional data, in order to better plan their meals and watch their
> diets. This API also helps users who are trying to combat obesity-related issues.
